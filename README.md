### Common compile errors:  

### If you edit Form1 or maybe some other forms and try to compile you may run into errors like:  
  
Type 'NJRAT.L1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Pp1' is not defined  
Type 'NJRAT.Gclass9' is not defined  
  
### These will happen during compiling, to fix them, follow this:

Change
```
Me.L1 = New NJRAT.L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New NJRAT.Pp1()
```
To
```
Me.L1 = New L1()
  
Me.Pp1 = New Pp1()
```
  
Remove the "NJRAT." and the errors will go away and not break the RAT.
